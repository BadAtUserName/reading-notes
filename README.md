###reading questions
1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

I started out using chat gpt on this and asked it to write me a poem in the voice of jane austen. Then i moved on to a few haiku's I finally decided on using a rhyming website and trying to write it for myself. 

all of my notes were taken from the reading.

http hypertext protocol does enthrall like a little phone call. To start it all out your computer says with a shout “Dear sever please fetch me the data this human wants to zoom in on” and the server replies “200 ok” even if you are on Broadway which is such a cliché. Sending packets with the speed of a cannonball. Packets are small as they travel the tubes and create little cubes; displayed for you on your screen what a scene.

2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

   
Html and css are the first things the browser will render from top to bottom. Javascript follow second which is why we should not put a <script></script> tag in the middle of the doc unless you use defer which means the browser will run all html-css first  then come back to javascript. Or you can just place it at the bottom before closing body tag </body>


3.How can you find images to add to a Website?

To find an image to use on a website you would first do an image search then open it to make sure it’s appropriate, Then you save the image somewhere that makes sense. As most images are copyrighted it is a good practice to make sure to use a COMMON CREATIVE LISENCE

4.How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

To create a string in JS it needs to have quotes around it ex “23” or “twenty three” to create a number you do not need quotes, but it must be only number symbols and not words as words would get an error. Ex 23
